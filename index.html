    <em>Personas</em>
    <notes>Lauri - Personas</notes>
    <notes>These are the developer personas that interact with the theme system.</notes>
    <notes>Accommodating the different personas (allowing both UI and code for many tasks) makes things more complex.</notes>
    <notes>Certain decisions are made with these personas in mind and they may prioritize one or more over the others.</notes>
    <notes>Different CMSes prioritize these in a different way (more on that later)</notes>

    <em>Priorities</em>
    <notes>Scott - Priorities</notes>
    <notes>Different CMSes prioritize the personas differently</notes>
    <notes>Flexibility and how usable is it?</notes>
    <notes>Often the prioritization is not explicit and sometimes whoever is driving the change determines the priorities, often with themselves in the #1 spot.</notes>
  </div>
    <div>
      <img src="assets/wp-rules.jpg" alt="Screenshot of WordPress with theme that looks like Bartik">
      <notes>We looked at some other CMSes to try to determine a rough priority. This is not scientific.</notes>

      Site builder<br>
      Backend<br>
      Themer

    <em>Problems</em>
    <notes>Lauri - Problems</notes>
    <notes>Beyond the clash that sometimes happens with these personas,</notes>
    <notes>the theme system has some other things to deal with.</notes>
  </div>
    <div>
      Security
      <notes>Autoescape</notes>
      <notes>User generated content</notes>
    </div>
    <div>
      Backwards compatibility
      <notes>Don't break people's sites</notes>
      <notes>Still be able to evolve</notes>
      <notes>Stable theme is a hacky way to do this in D8 and adds another layer of complexity</notes>
    </div>
    <div>
      UI/code mismatch
      <notes>Set a field order in manage display</notes>
      <notes>Themer overrides the template and moves the fields around</notes>
      <notes>This breaks the UI. In the end themers have the final say for the most part.</notes>
    </div>
    <div>
      Complexity
      <notes>All these and related make the theme system complex and hard to evolve.</notes>
    </div>
  <div data-bodyclass='woah'>
    <em>Frameworks</em> have
    no site builder persona
    <notes>Scott - Frameworks</notes>
    <notes>Lower complexity in the theme system</notes>
    <notes>Example: Symfony people may think we are using Twig wrong but they are not using Twig in a CMS context so it’s completely different. Twig is just a tool and the context in which it is used will change how it is used. We have to account for the site builder persona.</notes>
    <notes>CMS often comes with preset templates and styling also.</notes>
    <notes>The short version of this is in most cases we shouldn't be comparing CMSes to frameworks.</notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    <em>Logo</em> is the simplest example
    <notes>Lauri - Logo</notes>
    <notes>In Drupal you can change the logo in Appearance</notes>
    <notes>You could also hardcode the logo into the page template</notes>
    <notes>When you hardcode the logo markup you break the UI and potentially break translation/localization</notes>
    <notes>WordPress doesn't have logo functionality at all</notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    <em>Forms</em> are horrible to theme
    <notes>Lauri - Forms</notes>
    <notes>Drupal forms are good for backend and site builder but themers have very little control and can't create forms from a template</notes>
    <notes>Some systems give you a bit more control over the forms for example Joomla and Concrete5. Joomla hardcodes all the form markup, Concrete5 has a form builder PHP class.</notes>
  </div>
  <div>
    Discuss
    <notes>Have you seen examples in other systems that you think are valuable?</notes>
    <notes>Which persona(s) to prioritize (always the same?)</notes>
    <notes>Who decides and when?</notes>
    <notes>Should we prioritize at all? Is making everyone happy possible?</notes>
    <notes>Components offer a reset switch but will we end up in a similar place?</notes>
